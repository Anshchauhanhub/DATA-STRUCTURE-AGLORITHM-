1. Learn about Complexities
In Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), the main goal is to solve problemse ffectivel and efficiently. 
To determine the efficiency of a program, we look at two types of complexities:

Time Complexity: This tells us how much time our code takes to run.
Space Complexity: This tells us how much memory our code uses.
Asymptotic Notation
To compare efficiencies of algorithms, we use asymptotic notation, a mathematical tool that estimates time based on 
input size without running the code. It focuses on the number of basic operations in the program.

Notation	Description
Big-O (Ο)	Describes the worst-case scenario, providing an upper time bound of algorithm.
Omega (Ω)	Describes the best-case scenario, offering a lower time bound of algorithm.
Theta (θ)	Represents the average complexity of an algorithm of algorithm.
The most commonly used notation for code analysis is Big O Notation, providing an upper limit on the running time or
 memory usage concerning the input size.
